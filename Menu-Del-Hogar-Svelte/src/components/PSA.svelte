    <h3>Welcome to my personal project!</h3>
    <p>This is a website made with Svelte for the frontend. The backend is done with Express JS which makes a call to a third party API.</p>    
    <p>This website is stil being developed but you can go ahead and search for recipes and enjoy cooking your favorite meals!</p>
